## 🔧 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. ✅ Web Version Not Working**
**Problem**: Web version had compatibility issues with voice recognition
**Solution**: 
- Added `Platform.OS` checks to detect web environment
- Disabled voice features on web with user-friendly messages
- Added proper error handling for web-specific issues
- Voice input shows "Voice input is not available on web" message

**Result**: Web version now works perfectly in browsers!

### **2. ✅ Mobile Keyboard Covering Input Field**
**Problem**: Keyboard was covering the text input area on mobile
**Solution**:
- Implemented `KeyboardAvoidingView` wrapper
- Added platform-specific behavior (`padding` for iOS, `height` for Android)
- Set proper `keyboardVerticalOffset` for iOS (90px)
- Improved input container styling with `alignItems: 'flex-end'`

**Result**: Text input now stays visible when keyboard is open!

### **3. ✅ Google AI Studio API Integration**
**Problem**: DuckDuckGo API was unreliable for web search
**Solution**:
- Replaced DuckDuckGo with Google AI Studio API
- Uses your free Google AI Studio API key
